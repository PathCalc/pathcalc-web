# Pathways Calculator

**PathCalc** (Pathways Calculator) is an interactive tool for visualising pathways from [OSeMOSYS](http://www.osemosys.org/). PathCalc allows users to explore in real-time a wide range of **pathways** for the future, illustrating how various choices affect emissions, costs, and energy.

The tool is based on the [2050 Calculator](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/2050-calculator/) concept, which has been applied to dozens of countries. However, while 2050 Calculators use simulation models, PathCalc uses a cost-optimisation model.

Each **lever** is a bundle of intervention points for reducing emissions, such as behavior change or decarbonisation targets. Each lever has four **ambition levels**, ranging from “no effort” (Level 1) to “transformational effort” (Level 4).
